## Recording Saree Purchases (Procurement)

*This section is primarily for procurement staff in Bangalore*

### Understanding the New Approval Process

**Important Change**: Saree purchases now require manager approval before final pricing is set. This gives managers control over additional costs and final pricing decisions.

### When to Submit a Purchase Request

Submit a purchase request immediately after buying from suppliers. The request will be pending until a manager reviews and approves it.

### Step-by-Step Purchase Request Submission

1. **Navigate to Procurement**
   - Click "Submit Purchase Request" from your dashboard
   - Or go to the "Procurement" section

2. **Enter Saree Details**
   - **Saree Name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Royal Blue Mysore Silk")
   - **Description**: Add details about the saree (pattern, weave, special features)
   - **Purchase Cost**: Enter the amount you paid in Indian Rupees (‚Çπ)
   - **Markup Percentage**: Leave blank to use default (20%) or enter a specific markup
   - **Image URLs**: Add links to photos if available

3. **Review and Submit**
   - Double-check all information
   - Click "Submit Request"
   - You'll see a confirmation that your request is pending approval

### What Happens After Submission

1. **Pending Status**: The saree appears in your catalog with "Pending" status
2. **Manager Review**: A manager will review your request
3. **Approval Process**: Manager may:
   - Approve as-is
   - Add additional costs (transportation, handling, etc.)
   - Adjust markup percentage
   - Reject the request (with reason)
4. **Final Pricing**: Only after approval will the final USD selling price be calculated

### Understanding the Approval Workflow

**Your Request** ‚Üí **Manager Review** ‚Üí **Approved/Rejected**

**If Approved**:
- Final selling price is calculated
- Saree becomes available for sale
- Any additional costs are tracked as business expenses

**If Rejected**:
- You'll see the reason for rejection
- You can discuss with your manager
- Resubmit if appropriate

### Example Approval Process

**Your Submission**: Saree for ‚Çπ15,000 with 20% markup
**Manager Review**: Adds ‚Çπ500 for transportation, changes markup to 25%
**Final Calculation**:
- **Total Cost**: ‚Çπ15,000 + ‚Çπ500 = ‚Çπ15,500
- **Exchange Rate**: 0.012 (‚Çπ1 = $0.012)
- **US Cost**: ‚Çπ15,500 √ó 0.012 = $186.00
- **Final Price**: $186.00 √ó 1.25 = $232.50
